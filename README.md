## Idea
To utilize existing libraries and image processing techniques to create new and interesting filters and presets for images.
For example - Coloring black and white images, Coloring selective portions of images, Enhancing image attributes like brightness, sharpness etc.

## Requirements
- [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pillow]( https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- [Keras]( https://keras.io)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org)

## Note
This is an exploratory project, where different experiments on image are to be performed by studying and implementing earlier work done and existing resources.
