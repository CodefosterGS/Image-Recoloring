## Idea
To utilize existing libraries and image processing techniques to create new and interesting filters and presets for images.
For example - Coloring black and white images, Coloring selective portions of images, Enhancing image attributes like brightness, sharpness etc.

## Note
This is an exploratory project, where different experiments on image are to be performed by studying and implementing earlier work done and existing resources.
